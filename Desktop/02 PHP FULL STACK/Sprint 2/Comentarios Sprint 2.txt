Primer error - Solucion:
Then we do a little tweak in the backup file to resolve this. Edit the database backup file in text editor and replace 

“utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci” with “utf8mb4_general_ci” and 
“CHARSET=utf8mb4” with “CHARSET=utf8“.

Segundo error

Error Code: 1253. COLLATION 'utf8mb4_general_ci' is not valid for CHARACTER SET 'utf8'
